{"title":"Local tsunamigenic sources in Greece, identified by pattern recognition","year":2022,"keywords":["water science and technology","atmospheric science","earth and planetary sciences"],"abstract":"2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.This study is an attempt to determine potential tsunamigenic morphostructural nodes in Greece using pattern recognition algorithms. The earthquakes that have produced local tsunamis in the region were confined to morphostructural nodes whose locations were found by morphostructural zoning. The recognition problem consisted in separating all nodes in the region into the tsunamigenic class and the non-tsunamigenic class based mainly on the geomorphologic parameters of the nodes. The data on tsunamigenic earthquakes in Greece for training the Cora-3 algorithm were taken from the GHTD global historical catalog of tsunamigenic events (http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/hazard\/tsu_db.shtml). The recognition procedure resulted in determining 27 tsunamigenic nodes, with most of these being situated in the southern tip of the Peloponnese Peninsula, as well as in the gulfs of Corinth and Patras. Three tsunamigenic nodes were identified in the area of the Malian Gulf on the Aegean coast of Greece. According to the relevant literature, most local tsunamis in Greece were initiated by submarine slides and slumps due to earthquakes. According to the characteristic geomorphologic features derived in this study, the tsunamigenic nodes are situated in settings of contrasting relief characterized by steep slopes. This favors submarine landslides when subjected to earthquake excitation. The results reported in this paper form a basis for developing a methodology to be used in long-term tsunami hazard assessment, supplying information on local potential tsunamigenic sources required for tsunami regionalization of coastal areas in Greece.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.1007\/s11069-022-05349-0","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Geomorphology | Geomorphology | Oceanography","cleaned_custom_domains":["geomorphology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Geomorphology","Oceanography"]}

This study investigates the spatiotemporal impacts of UF on CO2 emissions by using Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model, in which UF is characterized by metrics across three dimensions underpinning sustainable development, namely environmental-aspect urban form (EnUF), economic-aspect urban form (EcUF) and social-aspect (SUF) urban form. The data are collected from 256 Chinese cities in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. The results reveal that: (1) On average, EnUF has two-sided effects on CO2 emissions; SUF and EcUF exert negative and positive effects on CO2 emissions respectively. (2) There is significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in terms of the impacts of UF variables on CO2 emissions. (3) As for EnUF variables, only the eastern coastal Chinese cities effectively show the benefits from urban compactness in terms of CO2 reduction. Increased urban complexity and sprawling lead to more CO2 emissions. The higher the diversity of carbon sink land, the more conducive to CO2 emission reduction. (4) With respect to SUF variables, population density and road density present U-shaped and inverted U-shaped relationship with CO2 emissions respectively. The accessibility of green space and water bodies contributes significantly to CO2 reduction. (5) As regards EcUF variables, the impact of the degree of economic agglomeration and related industry diversity on CO2 emissions changes from positive to negative in some cities. The impact of unrelated industry diversity on CO2 emissions is spatially characterized as negative coastal areas surround the positive inland areas. This study casts a new light on the impacts of UF on CO2 emissions and also proposes differentiated policy implications for carbon emission reduction in different Chinese cities.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.1016\/j.eiar.2022.106850","asjc_domain":["social sciences & humanities","physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["environmental science","social sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Policy and Governance | Social Sciences & Humanities | Ecology","cleaned_custom_domains":["ecology","policy and governance","social sciences & humanities"],"annotation":["Ecology","Policy and Governance"]}
{"title":"Mapping bathymetry and shallow water benthic habitats in inland and coastal waters with Sentinel-2","year":2023,"keywords":["aquatic science","ecology","water science and technology"],"abstract":"Accurate determination of the water depth and benthic macroalgae composition in coastal and inland water bodies is important due to the high commercial and ecological value of these regions. Benthic habitat mapping by conventional methods provides good accuracy, but these methods are very expensive and limited by manpower and time factor, which is necessary for mapping large areas. Remote sensing methods significantly complement contact measurements and give additional information about the hard-to-reach areas. The usefulness of free Sentinel-2 data in bathymetry and habitat mapping has been demonstrated in clear oceanic waters. The aim of this study was to further test the suitability of Sentinel-2 imagery in creating maps of dominant benthic types, as well as in estimating ba-thymetry in optically complex marine and lake waters. Two study sites were selected to cover a representative range of optical variability-Lake Garda in northern Italy (an intermediate between clear ocean and optically very complex waters) and Viimsi peninsula on the Estonian side of the Gulf of Finland, in the Baltic Sea. The results show that Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m spatial resolution is suitable for bathymetry and habitat mapping in optically complex inland and coastal waters. Our results show that bathymetry mapping is suf-ficiently accurate in waters less than 4 m deep in the case of the Baltic Sea and up to 7 m deep in Lake Garda. In such depths, the R2 was above 0.93 in all four Sentinel-2 images used in the study. Bottom type mapping accuracy was in all cases over 73%, which is considered to be good, but due to the limited number use only of sampling points in both test sites, further studies are needed. The Sentinel-2 data quality and no cost of the imagery for users make it very useful for mapping bathymetry and shallow water habitats over large coastal areas or high number of lakes, especially in hard to reach by in situ methods areas. Moreover, the frequent revisit time allows moving from one-off maps to monitoring of temporal changes happening in dynamic shallow inland and coastal waters. ercial.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.4081\/jlimnol.2023.2091","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","environmental science"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Oceanography | Engineering","cleaned_custom_domains":["ecology","engineering","oceanography"],"annotation":["Ecology","Hydrology"]}

They are known to produce diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins in coastal areas worldwide, but so far, evidence from the Baltic Sea is scarce, and the fate and transfer of their toxins in the ecosystem is poorly known. Occurrence of Dinophysis and DSP toxins was studied on the southwest coast of Finland in late July-September 2004 by sampling the water column down to the thermocline. DSP toxin profiles were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from the thermocline sample from material collected with a sediment trap. Maximum abundances of D. acuminata (7,280 cells L-1) and D. rotundata (880 cells L -1) were above the thermocline, but D. norvegica (maximum 200 cells L-1) was most abundant in the thermocline region. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) was found during the entire study period. Cellular PTX-2 content in Dinophysis varied between 1.6 and 19.9 pg PTX-2 cell-1. Dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) was found in samples after mid-August in concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 149 pg DTX-1 cell-1. PTX-2 and DTX-1 were found in all sediment trap samples. The estimated sedimentation rate of PTX-2 was 0 to 15.4 ng m-2 d-1 and DTX-1 0 to 190 ng m-2 d-1, corresponding 0.01% of PTX-2 and 1% of DTX-1 of the integrated water column DSP pool during a 6-week period. Sedimenting organic matter did not contain intact Dinophysis cells, but copepod fecal pellets found in the sediment traps indicated that fecal pellets are the major pathway of DSP toxins to the bottom. The major fraction of the PTX-2 and DTX-1 was either decomposed in the water column or transferred to higher trophic levels in the planktonic food chain. 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.","decade":2000,"doi":"10.4319\/lo.2006.51.5.2300","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Chemistry | Oceanography | Ecology","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Chemistry","Sedimentology"]}

Tsunami is now generally well known to coastal residents. Evacuation plans gradually become common for tsunami disasters. Storm surges arise more frequently due to strong storms but coastal residents are not well protected and not informed how to evacuate in case of surge emergency. From the field surveys conducted, it appeared that the damage depend on the geographical and social conditions of each of the areas that were visited by the author. It is now clear that such issues play important roles in disaster mechanisms. Therefore disaster risk management should carefully include local topography and social conditions of each area during the formulation of disaster prevention plans.

The images were pretreated by radiometric calibration in order to avoid the temporal deviation of spatial and spectral information. The exact shorelines were estimated by two steps of image processing techniques: Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to classify the land and sea water by and Sobal edge detection techniques are used to extract boundary line between land and water body. The rate of changes between the period 1973 and 2006 has shown that, the average shoreline rate is accelerated in the study area at 1.78 m\/year.

We obtained detailed major and trace elements, whole-rock Nd + zircon Hf isotope data, and U-Pb age data from several Mesozoic granites, including the Fuling (FL), Taiping-Huangshan (TH), Lingshan (LS), Sanqingshan (SQS), and Baijuhuajian intrusions in order to investigate their sources and petrogeneses related to extension in South China. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of zircon from the FL, TH, SQS, and LS bodies yield Early Cretaceous ages of 124-135 Ma. These plutons are alkali-feldspar granites to syenogranites- monzogranites, and show A-type affinities. They have high K2O and total alkali contents, and are enriched in rare earth elements (except for Eu), Zr, and other high-field-strength elements as well as high Ga\/Al ratios, and are depleted in Ba and Sr. These granites are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous (ACNK from 0.81 to 1.27). The whole-rock Nd(T) values of -5.34 to -0.96 are coupled with zircon Hf(T) values (from -5.3 to +4.24), and all samples plot along the mantle array. Field observations, geochronology, geochemistry, Nd isotopic, and zircon Hf isotopic compositions suggest that they formed by the partial melting of Mesoproterozoic metamorphic basement, with input from juvenile, mantle-derived materials in the shallow (<30 km) crust at high temperatures (756-965C). These melts underwent crystal fractionation of biotite, plagioclase, and K-feldspar. The upwelling of asthenosphere triggered partial melting of the metamorphic protolith in a back-arc or intra-arc rift setting, reflecting rollback of the Pacific plate.

{"title":"Effects of different curing methods on physicochemical parameters and volatile flavor components of Trachinotus ovatus","year":2021,"keywords":["ecology, evolution, behavior and systematics","aquatic science","management, monitoring, policy and law"],"abstract":"2021 Shanghai Ocean University. All rights reserved.Trachinotus ovatus is a marine commercial fish because of high nutritional value and special flavour, which is widely cultured in Guangdong, Fujian and other southern coastal areas in China. In recent years, as the production of T. ovatus increases, T. ovatus in the domestic market is mainly sold live or chilled, causing many problems such as short shelf life, low economic benefits and so on. Salting is one of traditional ways to preserve or to process fish. Salting is based on the penetration of salt into the fish muscles as a direct consequence of its ability not only to reduce water activity of fish muscles and inhibit the growth of microorganisms, but also improve the quality and flavour of the product. Because T. ovatus has no muscle spines, it is suitable to extend the shelf life of products and improve the added value of products by salting, air drying and other techniques. Traditional curing methods include dry salting, wet salting and mixed-salting and they have some shortcomings such as slow curing speed and uneven curing. With the development of technology, ultrasonic assisted curing and ultra-high pressure assisted curing have been developed, which has the advantages of fast curing speed and good product quality. At present, there are few reports on the comparison between the new curing methods and the traditional curing methods. In order to explore the effects of dry salting, wet salting and ultrasonic assisted curing on the physicochemical parameters and volatile flavor components of T. ovatus, the basic nutritional components, salt content, pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, fatty acid composition and volatile flavor compounds of salted fish were determined and analyzed. The results showed that after different curing processes the protein and fat content of T. ovatus increased, but the moisture content of T. ovatus decreased. The moisture contents of dry salted, wet salted and ultrasonic assisted salted fish were 53.71% 0.97%, 61.45% 0.72%, 59.29%1.41%, respectively. Compared with fresh T. ovatus, the salt content of dry salted, ultrasonic assisted salted and wet salted fish increased, which were (3.29 0.15), (2.64 0.02) and (2.15 0.11) g\/100 g, respectively. However, the pH value of T. ovatus decreased after different curing processes. After curing processing, the lipids of fish meat underwent oxidation reaction, the TBA value increased. The TBA values of dry salted, wet salted and ultrasonic assisted cured fish were (0.800.07)(0.550.09) and (0.730.08) mg MDA\/kg. The fatty acid composition changed after curing processes with increase of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids and decrease of poly-unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, 54, 56, 62 and 57 volatile flavor compounds were detected from T. ovatus, dry salted, wet salted and ultrasonic assisted salted fish respectively. The volatile flavor compounds were mainly aldehydes, alcohols and ketones, which played an important role in flavor formation. The results showed that compared with the other two methods, the water content of dry salted fish was the lowest, but both the salt content and TBA value was the highest. The relative content of aldehydes and alcohols in the volatile flavor compounds of fish cured by ultrasonic assisted was the highest, and the pH value was the lowest. This study can provide technical and theoretical reference for curing processing and production process optimization.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.11964\/jfc.20210412727","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","environmental science"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Chemistry | Engineering","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","engineering"],"annotation":["Ecology","Social Sciences & Humanities"]}

(2) The highest levels of DDT compounds seem to occur in the animals of the southern Baltic and the Sound (Oresund). (3) The highest contents of methylmercury in the Baltic fish occur in certain coastal areas, usually polluted by pulp mill wastes, while the fish caught in the open sea seem to be less contaminated.

A total of 105 species and forms of HNF from 13 large taxa and a group of uncertain taxonomic position were identified. The taxa Choanoflagellida and Chrysomonadida were represented by the largest number of species in all the littoral zones studied. Fewer species of HNF were recorded in the littoral zone affected by the bird colonies than in areas outside the zones of their influence. The maximum number of species (81) was recorded in the protected overgrown littoral zone, and the minimum (48 species), in the open littoral zone near the heron colony. In the entire littoral area, 35 species were common. Among them, three species (Bodo designis, Paraphysomonas imperforata, and Spumella sp. 1) had a high frequency of occurrence (50%). However, the basis of the diversity of the GNF was formed by the species, the frequency of occurrence of which was less than 20%.

Arsenic is a toxic element that is strongly adsorbed to sediments, offering a potential risk to deposit-feeding invertebrates, and ultimately to consumers higher up coastal food chains. This study uses biodynamic modelling to predict the uptake and accumulation of arsenic from water and sediment in a deposit-feeding polychaete worm that is a major source of food to fish and wading birds in estuaries. Abstract Arsenic (As V) uptake and bioaccumulation from water and ingested sediment by the deposit-feeding polychaete Nereis diversicolor has been investigated using biodynamic modelling. Worms accumulated As from solution linearly at dissolved concentrations from 2 to 20gL -1 (uptake rate constant 0.057lg -1day -1 at 10C, 16-psu salinity), and the As assimilation efficiency from ingested sediment was 28.9%. Efflux rate constants of As taken up from water and ingested sediment were 0.0488 and 0.0464day -1 and did not differ significantly. Sediment As concentrations, ranging from very high to low, were measured at eight estuarine sites, and the model predicted accumulated As concentrations in resident N. diversicolor. Comparisons of predicted against independently measured As concentrations in locally collected worms showed that the model generally performed well, highlighting the potential of biodynamic modelling in predicting the uptake and therefore ecotoxicity of As in estuarine sediments. 2011 CSIRO.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1071\/EN10089","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["chemistry","environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Chemistry | Ecology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology"],"annotation":["Chemistry","Sedimentology","Ecology"]}
{"title":"Spatial and temporal distribution of fish and zooplankton in a shallow lake","year":2003,"keywords":["aquatic science"],"abstract":"1. We performed both a large- and a small-scale echo sounding study on the spatial and temporal distribution of fish (mainly roach, Rutilus rutilus and perch, Perca fluviatlis), as well as a small-scale study of zooplankton distribution in the small, shallow and eutrophic Lake Hanebjerg in Denmark. In the small-scale study, sampling was conducted in open water as well as in the edge zone immediately outside two different types of vegetation. 2. Fish daytime abundances differed between the northern and the southern parts of the lake and, on a small scale, small fish aggregated in the edge zones during day, preferably outside dense emergent vegetation. Copepods avoided emergent vegetation, while cladocerans showed no habitat preference. Both small fish and cladoceran numbers were found to be higher during night than day. 3. The relative abundance (number per sample) of cladocerans in the edge zone immediately outside vegetation was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of fish in that zone. There was no correlation between cladoceran and fish abundance in open water, or between the relative abundance of copepods and fish. 4. The presence of pelagic piscivores in combination with avoidance behaviour of both fish and zooplankton is a likely explanation for the observed distribution of small fish and cladocerans in Lake Hanebjerg. Both small- and large-scale distribution patterns may be dependent on the type and distribution of complex structure in the lake.

It is affected by climate change, and Land Use\/Land Cover Change (LULCC). This paper quantifies the combined impact of LULCC and climate change on water yield over short and long-term periods in the Haraz basin, Iran. This basin has experienced severe forest degradation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization. Most agricultural lands are within the plains and coastal areas, and 25% of the basin is covered by forest, which includes part of the Hyrcanian conservation forests. Four scenarios to distinguish the relative portion of Land Use\/Land Cover (LULC) and climate for water supply variations are considered, including real conditions at the beginning of the period (Sn1), real conditions without changes in LULC (Sn2), real conditions without climate change (Sn3), and real conditions at the end of the period (Sn4). Four study periods include 19922007, 20072016, 20162026 as a short term, and 19922026 as a long-term period. The spatial patterns of annual precipitation showed decreasing amounts in the three studied years from the northwest to the south. Water yield also reduced during the study period 19922007 and 20072016, and climate change plays an essential role in this reduction. Forecasts show that rainfall will recover in 2026 and water yield will increase in the northern sub-basins. In the long run, from 1992 to 2026, the contribution of LULCC and climate change factors to water yield are equal.

Although there are abundant sand-riched reservoirs developed in tidal sand ridges, surprising that few people can intuitively identify the distribution in ancient strata. By comparing the seismic microfacies and seismic Root Mean Square Amplitude attribute of high-precision 3-D seismic data, we summarized a new method to identify and describe their superposition and plane distribution.

This study aims to identify the settings of the physical forces that lead to a large-scale depletion of dissolved oxygen in Kuwait Bay at the northwest of the Arabian Gulf. The assessment, made with a validated three-dimensional numerical model (Alosairi and Alsulaiman, 2019), revealed that the pollution from the outfalls leads to nearfield depletion of dissolved oxygen but has only a minor effect on the bay-scale dissolved oxygen. This is a result of the strong dynamics of Kuwait Bay, which mixes the pollutant rapidly before it is transported seawards. Offshore, a low dynamic region has been identified near Jahra Bay which is susceptible to occasional dissolved oxygen depletion. Assessment of the physical forces revealed that the density-driven current and, to a greater extent the wind regime, controlled the formation of a hypoxic parcel near Jahra Bay. The combination of neap tides and low mixed winds reduced mixing and enabled the longer residence times of Kuwait Bay. These are the most critical circumstances, as the average dissolved oxygen can be reduced by 50% during summer. The circumstance resulting in low dynamics near Jahra Bay were also found to be effective in explaining algal blooms.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2020.111311","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Oceanography | Hydrology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","hydrology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Hydrology","Chemistry","Oceanography","Ecology"]}

The planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme is a critical parameter for accurate meteorology simulations and air quality predictions. In this study, we analyze the impact of four typical PBL schemes, namely, Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino Level 2.5 (MYNN), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2), and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL, within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to assess their impacts on the simulations of air pollutant concentrations based on the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, one of the most developed city clusters in eastern China. The results indicate that the MYNN scheme performs best in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) simulations, with mean bias of 4.8 g m3 and 9.3 g m3 in summer and 11.7 g m3 and 5.4 g m3 in winter, respectively. The YSU scheme performs best for ozone (O3) prediction, with better simulation results in summer than in winter. Notably, some discrepancies among different PBL schemes in the prediction of air pollution are directly associated with the complex topography. For the prediction of PM2.5, the MYJ and YSU schemes tend to overestimate the concentrations in the plains of Jiangsu and northern Anhui while underestimating PM2.5 in the hilly areas compared with the MYNN scheme. Meanwhile, the performance of the ACM2 scheme is opposite to that of the MYJ and YSU schemes.

These models have typically been derived using data from satellite altimeters such as TOPEX\/Poseidon. Therefore the Arctic ocean components of tide models are not constrained by altimetry data, potentially resulting in errors that are likely to alias into monthly GRACE gravity fields at all latitudes. Seven years of GRACE inter-satellite accelerations are inverted to solve for corrections to the amplitude and phase of major solar and lunar ocean tides at latitudes north of 50N using a mascon approach. The tide model originally applied to our data was FES2004, truncated to maximum degree lmax = 90. Simulations are performed to verify that our inversion algorithm works as designed. Uncertainty estimates are derived from tidal solutions on land, and by subtracting two independent solutions that each use 3.5 years of data. Features above the noise floor in the M2, K1, S2, and O1 solutions likely represent errors in FES2004. Errors due to truncating the spherical harmonic expansion of FES2004 are too small, and errors in the land mask model (needed to transform sea surface heights into mass) only affect coastal areas and do not produce similar relative amplitudes for any examined tides. In the oceans north of 50N, these residuals tend to reduce the FES2004 amplitudes for M2, K1, S2, and O 1. Reductions in the variance of accelerations not used in our inversion suggest that our results can be used to improve GRACE processing.

Mathematical methods that use easily measured variables to predict difficult-to-measure variables are important to mangrove managers. As a result, standard plant methods and allometric equations have been developed for several decades to estimate mangrove biomass.

Because mangroves are usually dwarf forests in higher latitude sites, and moreover, the crown bases and multi-stems of dominant individuals may begin within a few decimeters of ground level, estimates of community production that depend on allometry based on single-stemed mangrove may not be accurate. Here, we develop allometric relations to predict total biomass and individual components of biomass (e. g., leaves, stemts, roots and butts) of K. obovata, a multi-stemmed mangrove, in the Aojiang Estuary, Zhejiang province. This procedure treated each stem as a discrete tree that shared a proportion of the butt and other elements common to all stems. Linear log-log relationships were obtained between biomass and stem diameter at one-tenth of the stem length nearly the ground. Population biomass of artificial K. obovata forest in Aojiang Estuary was calculated according to the function model. We compared the difference on population biomass of K. obovata in different regions of China. The results showed that K. obovata biomass (W) correlated to the stem diameter (D) at a significance level (P < 0. 001). The function model between plant biomass (leaf, WL; stem, WS; Root and butt, WB; and total, WT) and stem diameter (D) was as follows: WL =0. 187D1. 855(R2 =0. 612, P < 0. 0001); WS =0. 267D1. 906(R2 =0. 821, P < 0. 0001); WB =4. 6D1. 136(R2 =0. 644, P < 0. 0001); WT = 3. 614D1. 446(R2 = 0. 801, P < 0. 0001). The regression relationship between K. obovata aboveground biomass and stand age and latitude was significant in different regions of China, that is, lg(aboveground biomass)= 3. 123 + 0. 84lg(stand age)-2. 019lg(latitude) (R2 = 0. 431, F2, 11 = 4. 161, P = 0. 045). Population biomass of K. obovata increased with increased stand age, while trend to decrease with increased latitude. Population biomass of 3-, 5-and 10- year-old K. obovata forest in Aojiang Estuary was estimated at 7. 13, 11. 32 and 24. 35 t\/ hm2, respectively. The 5-year-old population biomass in this experiment was only of 18% compared with the same age population of K. obovata grown in natural wetlands in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province. However, the biomass of 3-year-old population grown in artificial wetlands in Shenzhen was only 9. 3% of the same age population biomass in this experiment. In addition, the regression relationship between population density and mean individual biomass was estimated based on the data of 11-year-old artificial pure K. obovata forest: lg(mean individual aboveground biomass)= 8. 468-2. 1 lg(population density), (R2 = 0. 961, F = 99. 764, P = 0. 001). This equation indicates that mean individual biomass increased with decreased population density and the self-thinning index was - 2. 1, which approximately accorded with the -3\/2 power law. Therefore, not only stand age and latitude affect K. obovata population biomass, but habitat types and population density are crucial to K. obovata population biomass accumulation.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.5846\/stxb201105160634","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","environmental science"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Ecology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology"],"annotation":["Ecology"]}

We present a descriptive and spatial network analysis of FL-CORS data collected during 2015 to 2018. We also quantified FBOs that were investigated and confirmed because of a filed complaint and the etiological agents involved in these outbreaks. An increasing number of unique complaints filed in FL-CORS was observed during 2015 to 2018, with a sharp increase during 2017 to 2018 and a different seasonal pattern in 2018. The preferred mechanism of reporting varied by age group, with younger people more frequently filing complaints online and older people preferring reporting in person or by phone. Spatial network analysis revealed that 87% of complaints had the same county of residence and county of presumed exposure. Frequency of complaints was negatively associated with linear distance between place of residence and place of exposure at the zip code level. Counties located in North and Central Florida, as well as some coastal areas in South Florida, had higher incidence rates of complaints. Those counties tend to have a large population density, and some are popular vacation destinations. On average, 96 FBOs were reported in Florida annually, of which 60% were confirmed with successful identification of the causative agent. The 56% of the confirmed FBOs were triggered by a complaint. Throughout the years, 2.4 to 2.8 FBOs and 1.4 confirmed FBOs were identified per 100 complaints. Ciguatera toxin was the cause of 40% of all FBOs in Florida, and only 28% of outbreaks were detected through complaints. In contrast, complaints were the main source of identifying outbreaks of norovirus, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, and scombroid food poisoning, as well as rare outbreaks of Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio vulnificus.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.4315\/JFP-20-138","asjc_domain":["life sciences","health sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","medicine"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Public Health |  |","cleaned_custom_domains":["public health"],"annotation":["Public Health"]}

Similar physical properties to those described in marine chalk reservoirs emphasize the interest in analysing and characterizing these carbonate facies within a lacustrine depositional system. Lithologically, they are calcitic and\/or dolomitic poorly cemented carbonate muds with no significant amounts of skeletal debris. Clay minerals such as illite, smectite and palygorskite are present between the carbonate crystals. Palygorskite is the most common, covering the carbonate crystals and forming sheets between them. These lacustrine chalky carbonates were formed in the basinal areas of the lake as the result of inorganic carbonate precipitation and\/or detrital sedimentation related to episodic reactivation of the adjacent fan systems. Their petrological, geochemical and physical properties indicate that few textural and compositional modifications occurred during diagenesis. Their main physical properties are a very low dry bulk and grain density (1.6-2.2 and 2.62 g\/cm3, respectively) and medium to high porosity (10-40%) due to micropores (<2 m, 70%) and macropores (>2 m, 30%). The convergence of lacustrine sedimentation dynamics (rapid sedimentation), the original mineralogy of these calcareous lacustrine muds (relatively stable low-magnesian calcite and dolomite), the early formation of the palygorskite cement of these muds, and the retention of Mg-enriched fluids in the pore system, were decisive in the partial inhibition of calcite cementation, compaction and recrystallization. The chalky carbonates are also intercalated between impermeable littoral carbonate facies that impeded fluid flow through their pore systems. 2004 B.V.

All rights reserved.Globally there are significant numbers of historic landfills, and in England alone there are over 1200 in low-lying coastal areas. Approximately one-third of these historic coastal landfills are near designated ecological sites, and without intervention, 10% are expected to start eroding within 40 years. Indeed, some sites are already eroding and releasing waste, and erosion is likely to become more common with the anticipated effects of climate change. Mitigating the pollution risk from all historic coastal landfills under threat of erosion would be prohibitively expensive; consequently, it is necessary to understand which sites pose the greatest pollution risk to prioritise management resources. This paper proposes a new risk screening assessment that can support coastal managers in identifying which historic coastal landfills pose the greatest pollution risk at a national scale for minimal cost using existing datasets. The proposed method determines an overall risk index for each site by considering the risk of pollution from eroding historic coastal landfills in two stages: the first stage assesses the risk of waste being released (waste release index), and the second assesses the risk to various receptors (pollution index). The highest risk sites can then be prioritised for further investigation or remediation.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1139\/anc-2018-0001","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["engineering","environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering | Policy and Governance | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","engineering","policy and governance"],"annotation":["Public Health","Oceanography","Geomorphology","Chemistry"]}
{"title":"Synoptic and dynamical analyses of ENSO extreme events over Australia","year":2013,"keywords":["information systems and management","modeling and simulation"],"abstract":"International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.The El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a major role in the variability of Australia's climate. Periodic droughts and wet conditions follow the ENSO phases. Understanding ENSO and its effects on Australia is never more important than in the cases of extreme events such as severe droughts or flooding. In this paper, we examine changes in the basic climate state over Australia during the two extreme flooding periods of January 1974 and January 2011. 1973-1976 and 2010-2012 are considered the two most severe La Nia periods in terms of precipitation and flooding in Australia since 1900. The largest floods occurred during January 1974 and late December 2010 through January 2011, in both cases flooding the Queensland and New South Wales coastal areas, and in the latter case causing floods inland and south down to Victoria. We employ complementary avenues of analysis, looking at both the synoptics and atmospheric dynamics of the southern hemisphere climate during these events. Synoptically, the circulation over Australia often changes significantly during La Nia phases. In strong La Nia periods, often there are persistent low pressure systems over Australia during flooding periods, replacing or displacing the typical high pressure system seen in neutral or El Nio conditions. In 2011, higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western Pacific, due to an unusually strong negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), caused lower pressure over the Indian Ocean, Australia, Indonesia and the western Pacific and above-average amounts of atmospheric moisture. These low pressure systems persisted over Australia with the aid of blocking high pressure systems in the Tasman Sea and easterly onshore winds. These events, coupled with anomalously strong westerly winds bringing down the large amounts of monsoonal tropical moisture, led to intense flooding. January 1974 was a similar case, albeit with a weaker negative IOD and smaller SST anomalies. To distinguish the classes of disturbances active during these events, their initial growth, growth rates, and interactions, we examine the leading dynamical modes in both cases. Dynamical modes associated with these flooding events are determined using a primitive equation instability model. We find that heavy rainfall is associated with increased growth rates of Kelvin waves, intraseasonal oscillations (ISO), monsoon disturbances, and associated blocking over the Tasman Sea, as well as some changes in the extratropical storm track modes. In particular, we find that the Kelvin wave grows explosively and is strongly convectively coupled in the Australian monsoonal region, enhancing convection over Australia. In addition, intraseasonal oscillations grow strongly in the Australian region and contribute to the convection and rainfall, at the same time. We find similar Kelvin waves and monsoonal modes in both events, although in 1974 both were slightly stronger than in 2011. Our dynamical analyses agree with the synoptic observations and provide a more complete description of the reasons for the severity of both events. It appears necessary for several factors to be both present and timed accordingly for flooding impacts to be maximal. In both 1974 and 2011, active monsoonal modes and intraseasonal oscillations met unusually rapidly growing Kelvin waves. In 2011, a strongly negative IOD with high SSTs made more moisture available. Understanding the nature of these extreme events over Australia is a fundamental step in the pursuit of accurate predictions of future ENSO impacts, Australia's future climate and climate extremes, and water resources planning.","decade":2010,"doi":null,"asjc_domain":["social sciences & humanities","physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["mathematics","decision sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Oceanography | Climatology | Engineering \n\n(Note: The article discusses the impacts of ENSO extreme events on Australia's climate, which is a topic within ocean","cleaned_custom_domains":["climatology","engineering","oceanography"],"annotation":["Climatology","Oceanography"]}

Important modifications of the surface tension and dilational rheology response have been observed already at the very low CTAB concentrations, where the effects due to the high ionic strength are negligible. The comparison with the effects of CTAB in different seawater models, or in natural seawater fractions, points out the establishment of strong interactions between the surfactant molecules and the lipophilic fraction of organic material dispersed\/dissolved in seawater, affecting the interfacial activity of the molecules.Considering the biochemical richness of seawater, these results can be explained assuming interaction mechanisms and adsorption schemes similar to those speculated for protein and other macromolecules in the presence of surfactants, which in fact show similar features. Thus already at the low concentrations the surfactant molecules form highly surface-active complexes with part of the organic fraction of seawater. At the larger surfactant concentrations these complexes compete for adsorption with an excess of free CTAB molecules which, according to the thermodynamic conditions, are most favoured to occupy the liquid interface.The results of this study underline the important role of the sea organic content in enhancing the surface-activity of surfactants, which is relevant for a deeper understand of the direct and indirect effects of these types of pollutants on the physico-chemical environment in the sea coastal areas and develop mitigation strategies.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1016\/j.colsurfb.2014.10.010","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["biochemistry","physics and astronomy","chemistry","chemical engineering"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Chemistry | Engineering | Oceanography","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","engineering","oceanography"],"annotation":["Chemistry","Oceanography"]}

The aim was to define seasonal succession patterns of phytoplankton in seven different areas of the Baltic sea, characterised by different salinity, climate, and trophic conditions and to delineate a set of phytoplankton community indicators that are independent of season and salinity, but indicative of trophic status of different coastal areas. The cluster analysis of the combined data set resulted in eight phytoplankton community types, common for all locations, and characterised by different taxonomic composition representing different stages of seasonal succession. A hierarchy of explanatory variables that best predicted the communities, dominated by either diatoms, cyanophytes, cryptophytes or dinoflagellates, was revealed through a redundancy analysis (RDA). Nutrients were not found to be significant factors shaping the common phytoplankton community types for all locations. RDA analysis at the location level, covering all seasonal succession stages, confirmed phytoplankton community composition to be sensitive to nutrient concentrations. Even with the limitations of utilizing databases from different sources we identified community types that were indicative of climatic conditions (particularly temperature), salinity and eutrophication. The dominance of cyanobacteria as such, would not be an appropriate indicator of trophic conditions in the Baltic Sea, in the areas where cyanobacteria blooms occur naturally. The structure of both diatom- and cyanophyte-dominated communities is governed by salinity, and thus the abundances of these groups cannot be directly used as an indicator across the whole Baltic Sea. 2005 Ltd.

A key aspect for obtaining ecologically and economically sustainable aquaculture in threatened coastal areas is the requirement of geographic information of growth and potential production capacity. Growth varies over time and space and depends on a complex pattern of interactions between the bivalve and a diverse range of environmental factors (e.g. temperature, salinity, food availability). Understanding these processes and modelling the environmental control of bivalve growth has been central in aquaculture. In contrast to the most conventional modelling techniques, quantile regression can handle cases where not all factors are measured and provide the possibility to estimate the effect at different levels of the response distribution and give therefore a more complete picture of the relationship between environmental factors and biological response. Observation of the relationships between environmental factors and growth of the bivalve Mytilus edulis revealed relationships that varied both among level of growth rate and within the range of environmental variables along the Swedish west coast. The strongest patterns were found for water oxygen concentration level which had a negative effect on growth for all oxygen levels and growth levels. However, these patterns coincided with differences in growth among periods and very little of the remaining variability within periods could be explained indicating that interactive processes masked the importance of the individual variables. By using quantile regression and local regression (LOESS) this study was able to provide valuable information on environmental factors influencing the growth of M. edulis and important insight for the development of ecosystem based management tools of aquaculture activities, its use in mitigation efforts and successful management of human use of coastal areas.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecss.2016.01.040","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Oceanography | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Ecology","Oceanography"]}

It therefore represents today in terms of protein quantity a source of great im portance to human food and will certainly be, soon, the most important source of aquatic ani mal protein available. However, most farms are located in these coastal areas heavily polluted, thus increasing the risk of seeing our breeding contaminated.

Recently, the effect of the sea factor on the economy and the settlement system has increased amid globalisation, geoeconomic changes, increasing geopolitical turbulence, and the growing competition for resources. In this article, I attempt to assess the influence of the sea factor on the socioeconomic geography of the Russian Federation. A country with an extensive coastline and a vast inland area, Russia has territories that are very different in geographical terms. I pay special attention to the post-Soviet changes in the major components of the country's maritime economy: seaports, fishing industry, offshore production, recreation, etc. Another focus is the assessment of these industries' impact on the development of the coastal areas. I demonstrate the growing dependence between the maritime economy and the economic development of Russia's inland regions. I identify the key natural geographic, foreign economy, settlement-related, and geopolitical factors of the coastalisation of the economy, infrastructure, and population, observed in Russia today. This process is taking place in the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Sea areas, as well as in the Arctic and Pacific regions of the country. I conclude that Russia's integration into the system of multi-dimensional Eurasian partnerships (including the Belt and Road initiative) and the 'turn to the East' contribute to both the further 'marinisation' of Russian space and the differentiation of coastal zones by the level and rates of socio-economic development.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.2478\/quageo-2019-0017","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Engineering | Policy and Governance","cleaned_custom_domains":["ecology","engineering","policy and governance"],"annotation":["Social Sciences & Humanities"]}

Thus, stringent regulations establishing limits to the microbiological contamination of water and seafood are needed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of Enterococci and Thermotolerant Coliform densities in the flesh of mussels Perna perna as an alternative tool for monitoring the microbiological quality of coastal waters. The study also considers allometric relations applied to clearance rates to understand rates of bacterial concentration. Bacterial loads obtained in mussels' flesh were from 50 to 4,300 times greater than in the water sampled in the vicinity of the mussels and some were considered inappropriate for consumption even when the water presented no restrictions. The mean clearance rate obtained for Enterococci retention was 317.7 ml h-1 and this rate (CR) is related to the mussels size (L) by the equation CR = 28.3229L1.6421. The results showed that bacterial densities in the mussels' tissues may reflect chronic contamination of the environment and that clearance rates are important for taking the best decision in situations where, for example, it is desired to introduce mussels for aquaculture and the evaluation of the water concerned is required.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1590\/s1679-87592010000700005","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Chemistry | Public Health","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","public health"],"annotation":["Ecology","Chemistry"]}

Despite the increase in boat traffic in the Mediterranean Sea, the effect on T. truncatus' habitat use has not been studied in detail and published data are limited. This study represents the first attempt to characterise spatial and temporal habitat use by T. truncatus and its relation to boat traffic in the Isole Pelagie Marine Protected Area (Italy) on the basis of an originally developed passive acoustic monitoring system (PAM). The devices were deployed in 2 areas in the southern waters of Lampedusa, during 2 separate years (2006 and 2009), each time for 3 months (from July to September) and in 6 time slots (3 diurnal and 3 nocturnal). Acoustic analysis showed that T. truncatus used the Southern coastal area of Lampedusa independently of the year, primarily during the early summer, a period coinciding with the peak of the calving season. Dolphin occurrences appeared independent of boat traffic, with the exception of the smallest temporal scale (time slots); dolphin occurrences were more prevalent during the night when the level of boat traffic was lower. This study provides evidence on T. truncatus habitat use in the Mediterranean Sea and reveals that boat traffic could be one of the factors influencing it, thus stressing the need for further detailed investigation regarding this topic.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.12681\/mms.561","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["environmental science","agricultural and biological sciences","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Engineering | Ecology","cleaned_custom_domains":["ecology","engineering"],"annotation":["Ecology","Oceanography"]}

A series of model runs were completed using biophysical data collected in Icy Strait, a regional salmon migration corridor, in May, June, July, August, and September of 2001. These data included a temperature (1-m surface versus surface to 20-m average), zooplankton standing crop (surface to 20-m depth versus entire water column), chum salmon diet (percent weight of prey type consumed), energy densities, and weight. Known numbers of hatchery releases were used in a cohort reconstruction model to estimate total abundance of hatchery and wild chum salmon in the northern region of southeastern Alaska, given average survival to adults and for two different (low and high) early marine littoral mortality rate assumptions. Total prey consumption was relatively insensitive to temperature differences associated with the depths potentially utilized by juvenile chum salmon. However, the magnitudes and temporal patterns of total prey consumed differed dramatically between the low and high mortality rate assumptions. Daily consumption rates from the bioenergetics model and CPUE abundance from sampling in Icy Strait were used to estimate amount and percentage of zooplankton standing crop consumed by mixed stocks of chum salmon. We estimated that only a small percentage of the available zooplankton was consumed by juvenile chum salmon, even during peak abundances of marked hatchery and unmarked mixed stocks in July. Total daily consumption of zooplankton by all stock groups of juvenile chum salmon was estimated to be between 330 and 1764 g\/km2 d1 from June to September in the neritic habitat of Icy Strait. As with any modeling exercise, model outputs can be misleading if input parameters and underlying assumptions are not valid; therefore, additional studies are warranted, especially to determine physiological input parameters, and to improve abundance and mortality estimates specific to juvenile chum salmon. Future bioenergetics modeling is also needed to evaluate consumption by the highly abundant, vertically migrating planktivorous that co-occurred in our study; we suggest that these fishes have a greater impact on the zooplankton standing crop in Icy Strait than do hatchery stock groups of juvenile chum salmon.

In order to look for potential reactions of nocturnal migrants to the sea\/land transition, the flight paths of night-migrating birds were recorded by tracking radar in autumn 1996 at the southern tip of Mallorca and at the E-W leading coast near Malaga. Within the tracking time of 40 s per individual there was no short-term adjustment of direction when crossing the coastline, neither were there differences in the average vertical speeds of birds approaching and leaving the coast. The mean altitudes of tracked birds, however, were about 9% higher above land than over water at both sites. Between-site comparison revealed higher average flight speeds of birds above the island than when leaving the mainland. At both sites important variation in flight behaviour was observed in the course of the night: near Malaga a continuous shift towards the E-W leading coast, simultaneously over water and land, suggests diminishing motivation to continue flights across the sea at times when decreasing fat reserves and\/or an endogenous rhythm dissuade from crossing an obstacle of unknown dimensions. Increasing proportions of reverse migration in the course of the night at both sites, with birds flying at low levels and low speeds, are additional indications of motivational conflicts between continuing migration and landing. Optimal migratory behaviour therefore does not necessarily imply that birds should follow the shortest route, but appears to be an adjustable compromise between risk avoidance and straight flight depending on endogenous and environmental conditions.","decade":1990,"doi":"10.2307\/3677169","asjc_domain":["life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Animal Science and Zoology | Behavior and Systematics","cleaned_custom_domains":["ecology"],"annotation":["Ecology"]}

Despite their major importance, the knowledge of the main characteristics of the majority of coastal areas (e.g., coastal bathymetry) is still very limited. This is mainly due to the scarcity and lack of accurate measurements or observations, and the sparsity of coastal waters. Moreover, the high cost of performing observations with conventional methods does not allow expansion of the monitoring chain in different coastal areas. In this study, we suggest that the advent of remote sensing data (e.g., Sentinel 2A\/B) and high performance computing could open a new perspective to overcome the lack of coastal observations. Indeed, previous research has shown that it is possible to derive large-scale coastal bathymetry from S-2 images. The large S-2 coverage, however, leads to a high computational cost when post-processing the images. Thus, we develop a methodology implemented on a High-Performance cluster (HPC) to derive the bathymetry from S-2 over the globe. In this paper, we describe the conceptualization and implementation of this methodology. Moreover, we will give a general overview of the generated bathymetry map for NA compared with the reference GEBCO global bathymetric product.

CECs include Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) and Neuro-Endocrine disruptors (NEDs) of vertebrates. However, most invertebrates only rely on neuroendocrine systems to maintain homeostatic processes. Although conserved neuroendocrine components have been characterized in ecologically relevant groups, limited knowledge on invertebrate neuroendocrinology makes it difficult to define EDCs and NEDs in most species. The monoamine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) acts both as a neurotransmitter and as a peripheral hormone in mammals. In molluscs, 5-HT is involved in multiple physiological roles and molecular components of the serotonergic system have been identified. This review is focused on the effects of CECs on the serotonergic system of bivalve molluscs. Bivalves are widespread in all aquatic environments, estuarine and coastal areas in particular, where they are exposed to a variety of chemicals. In bivalves, 5-HT is involved in gametogenesis and spawning, oocyte maturation and sperm motility, regulates heart function, gill ciliary beating, mantle\/siphon function, the catch state of smooth muscle and immune responses. Components of 5-HT transduction (receptors and signaling pathways) are being identified in several bivalve species. Different CECs have been shown to affect bivalve serotonergic system. This particularly applies to antidepressants, among the most commonly detected human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. In particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently detected in seawater and in bivalve tissues. Information available on the effects and mechanisms of action of SSRIs on the serotonergic system of adult bivalves is summarized. Data are also reported on the effects of CECs on development of neuroendocrine pathways of early larval stages, in particular on the effects of model EDCs in the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Overall, available data point at the serotonergic system as a sensitive target for neuroendocrine disruption in bivalves. The results contribute drawing Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for model EDCs and SSRIs in larvae and adults.

In fact,due to rural depopulation a large majority of the people and the economicactivities are nowadays concentrated in the coastal cities of the Mediterraneansea along 1 200 km of coast. The good physico-chemical features ofMediterranean seawater (19 C and medium salinity as compared to Persiangolf seawater which exhibits 30 C and much higher salinity) make ofMediterranean desalination plants more profitable with less operating costs andbetter efficiencies The reverse osmosis has been chosen as the best desalinationprocess because it has seen many improvements of its technology especially withregard to better performance and longer lasting membranes. The present studyhas focussed on three small desalination plants located not far from the capitalcity Algiers namely : Palm-beach sea resort, la Fontaine and Bou-Ismal.Our main objective was directed towards the evaluation of the cost of thechemical consumables and the overall cost oft the desalinated cubic meter ofwater.

{"title":"The contribution made to cliff instability by Head deposits in the west Dorset coastal area","year":1979,"keywords":["engineering"],"abstract":"In the west Dorset coastal area superficial materials include Head deposits which, by the nature of their origin, are variable in structure and composition. Two broad types are recognized depending on the provenance of the predominant constituent: Cretaceous Head and Lias Head. The Cretaceous Head was probably formed near to or at the end of the Devensian stage of the Late Pleistocene. Where the two types of Head deposit are superimposed, Cretaceous Head always lies above Lias Head. On many slopes Lias Head has topographic expression as lobate sheet forms which are frequently masked by a blanket of Cretaceous Head. The high permeability of Cretaceous Head together with the low strength of Lias Head produce slopes presenting potentially unstable conditions to depths of up to 4 m below ground surface. Three minor types of instability are generated in the Head deposits themselves: shallow translational movements, block slides, and shallow rotational slides. In addition, the high permeability of Cretaceous Head permits water to be introduced to undercliff areas, thus facilitating the development of instabilities in the solid formations below. This results in a mechanism of cliff-top retreat which is quite independent of cliff-toe erosion. The events at sites in Lyme Regis and Charmouth are summarized to illustrate the hazard presented by Head deposits in cliff-top areas. 1979 The Geological Society, London.","decade":1970,"doi":"10.1144\/GSL.QJEG.1979.012.04.03","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["engineering"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering | Geomorphology | Hydrology","cleaned_custom_domains":["engineering","geomorphology","hydrology"],"annotation":["Geomorphology","Sedimentology"]}

Although all minimum durability requirements stated by existing design may be met, more and more owners are willing to invest somewhat more in order to obtain an increased and more controlled durability and service life beyond what is possible when only meeting durability requirement based on current standards. Asset Life Extension Management (ALEM) program can be developed for improvement of durability, service life and service life prediction and to plan for appropriate periodic or ad-hoc intervention, maintenance, improvement, repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures during intended operation life. This paper presents a practical methodology to assess the concrete resistance to environmental and time dependent degradations such as freeze thaw, alkali-aggregate reaction, sulphate attack, carbonation, chlorides, etc., and concrete cover. The paper also discusses the additional measures and mitigation options to address the degradation mechanism and to extend the life of a structure. This resulted in development of life extension options and in combination with the prevention strategy to develop an asset life extension management program. A case study of life extension of a gas processing plant in coastal area is presented assessing remnant life of 370 concrete structures.

As an incident equilibrium sea state passes over a submerged step or bar, non-equilibrium dynamics appears locally and forces the sea state to a new, finite-depth equilibrium along with strong non-Gaussian statistics and an intensified occurrence probability of large waves. In this study, the experimental case Run 3 reported by Trulsen et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 882, 2020, R2) has been investigated numerically with a fully nonlinear model. Furthermore, as both shoaling and de-shoaling effects exist in the set-up with a bar-profile bottom, an additional simulation with a step-profile bottom is performed to isolate the de-shoaling effects. The model is proven excellent by the confrontation of the measurements and simulated results in both time and spectral domains. Strong non-Gaussian behaviour of the sea state is highlighted after the up-slope transition by combining spectral and bi-spectral analyses, and characteristic parameters. With a harmonic extraction approach, we show evidence that both second-and third-order effects triggered by the non-equilibrium dynamics significantly enhance the local kurtosis and occurrence of extreme waves. The statistics of kinematics shows the asymmetry of the wave field evolves somewhat independently in the horizontal and vertical directions. By comparing the simulations of bar-and step-profile cases, we find the de-shoaling process is responsible for the upstream modulation of nonlinear and dispersive parameters, and the enhancement of kurtosis of both horizontal and vertical velocities and horizontal acceleration over the down-slope area.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.1017\/jfm.2020.1125","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["engineering","physics and astronomy"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering | Oceanography | Geomorphology","cleaned_custom_domains":["engineering","geomorphology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Oceanography"]}

Light spectra, steady-state (after 1h) microprofiles of O2, gross photosynthesis (Pg), community respiration in light (RL) and net community photosynthesis (Pn) were measured in diatom- and cyanobacteria-dominated communities below increasing layers of Ulva. Photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) decreased exponentially with increasing layers of algae and the light spectrum was increasingly enriched in the green and deprived in blue and red regions. Sediment Pg, Pn and RL decreased as the number of Ulva layers increased; however, 1.6 times higher macroalgal density was necessary to fully inhibit cyanobacteria Pg compared with diatoms, indicating that cyanobacteria were better adapted to this light environment. Long-term (3 weeks) incubations of diatom-dominated sediments below increasing layers of Ulva resulted in a shift in the taxonomic composition of the MPB towards cyanobacteria. Hence, changes in the light climate below macroalgal accumulations can negatively affect the photosynthetic activity of sediments. However, spectral niche differentiation of MPB taxonomic groups and concurrent changes in the MPB community may provide sediments with increased resilience to the detrimental effects of eutrophication. 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2012.00335.x","asjc_domain":["life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Sedimentology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","sedimentology"],"annotation":["Ecology","Sedimentology"]}

In LPBR, seagrasses have been identified as the largest and best conserved ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico. There is a diverse biotic community associated with seagrasses, where fish are the most abundant macrofauna. The objective of this research is to describe the spatial and temporal behavior of the biomass of seagrasses and fish in the littoral portion of the reserve. A database of temperature and precipitation from three meteorological stations was built to describe the regional climatic behavior. Four sampling campaigns were conducted, visiting 12 previously located sites. At each site, environmental variables were measured, and samples of seagrasses were gathered by free immersion; also, fish samples were taken with an experimental trawl. The general weather in the reserve has two defined seasons (rainy and dry). This weather regulates the environmental variables registered in the sampling sites, and it is possible to identify associations between the abundance of both grasses and fish. Grass biomass reaches maximum values of 664.9 g\/m2, and fish biomass 1.61 g\/m2. We identified 12 dominant fish among which Lagodon rhomboides and Haemulon plumierii stand out.

In this study, using the maximum entropy model (Max -Ent), potentially suitable habitats for the Anatolian leopard in Trkiye was surveyed. When evaluating leopard habitat preference, the fact that the species can easily adapt to its habitat and live anywhere with sufficient vegetation and sufficient prey animals was taken into account; only data on climate which affects the geographic distribution patterns and population structures of flora and fauna were examined before. When the climatic variables affecting leopard distribution were examined, the following had the highest values: isothermally, seasonal temperature, average temperature of the coldest season, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and annual precipitation. Except for the Central Anatolia Region and coastal areas, almost every region in Trkiye contains habitats suitable for the leopard. There are scarce data on leopards populations and habitats in Trkiye. Therefore, even though ecological niche modelling (ENM) may generate important results when determining potentially suitable habitats, it is clear that this model cannot yield accurate results without considering the areas that the species is known to inhabit but in which no studies were previously conducted.

However, ecological and physiological attributes that favor dominance of these flagellates in the region have not been fully explored. The overall aim of this work was to characterize the phytoplankton pigments and assemblages in relation to environmental conditions during three successive summer cruises (2013, 2014 and 2015) in the Gerlache Strait a coastal area in the northern WAP. Data on phytoplankton (through HPLC\/CHEMTAX pigment analysis) and associated physical (water column structure) and chemical (macronutrients) parameters were determined. Cryptophytes were conspicuously found in shallow mixed layers, under stratified conditions, as the main contributors to total phytoplankton biomass. Their greatest contributions were associated with warmer surface waters at the northwestern sector of the strait. Other phytoplankton groups (Phaeocystis antarctica in 2013 and small diatoms in both 2014 and 2015) were also important components. Photoprotective carotenoids (mainly alloxanthin), with an important role in preventing photodamage caused by excess light, were closely linked with the dominance of cryptophytes at surface layers. The results of this study suggest that the prevalence of cryptophytes in WAP coastal waters can be, to a great extent, due to a particular ability of those small flagellates to successfully grow in highly illuminated conditions in shallow upper mixed layers and strong water column stratification.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1016\/j.dsr2.2017.02.010","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Oceanography | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","oceanography"],"annotation":["Ecology","Oceanography"]}

Our results revealed that the sources were located inland at high altitudes with a decreasing area trend in the south and an increasing area trend in the north, whereas the sinks were spread in coastal areas and exhibited a decreasing trend with relatively stable spatial distribution.

The development and utilization of solar energy is regarded as an effective means to solve the global energy crisis and climate problems, and the development and utilization of solar energy resources are increasing year by year. In this article, solar energy is selected as the research object. Based on the collection of large amounts of data and links to previous studies, the reserves of solar energy resources in China have been estimated and the spatial characteristics described. In addition to the conditions of the data itself, other factors affecting the large-scale development and use of solar energy are also analyzed. Through the establishment of an index system for the first time and the use of decision analysis methods to comprehensively evaluate the potential of large-scale development and utilization of solar energy in various regions of mainland China, this also provides ideas for the development and utilization of new energy potential in various regions in the future. Finally, under the teaching reform model, based on the imbalance phenomenon in college English teaching, based on empirical evidence and hypothesis, it provides a framework for optimizing the university environmental curriculum. The research results provide a practical starting point and reference value for improving the teaching quality of English courses in coastal colleges and universities, improving the teaching mode, and promoting the development of the lifelong learning concept of students and teachers.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.1007\/s12517-021-07339-1","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering |  |","cleaned_custom_domains":["engineering"],"annotation":["Engineering","Social Sciences & Humanities"]}

Because of that, as many as 13 groundwater represented of well that located close to Terengganu coastline were sampled and analyzed. Samplings were conducted for the wet and dry seasons and also for the high and low tides at the same sampling wells to identify the variation of groundwater quality temporally. A Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to locate the exact coordinates of each sampling well. Nineteen physico-chemical parameters were analyzed from groundwater samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was adopted to observe the contrast of the compositional pattern among the variables and to recognize the factors that influence the parameters as an input to define water intrusion. Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Analysis (HACA) is performed on data to group the sampling wells into a few clusters. The results show that from nineteen parameters only five has strong positive loading; EC (0.99), TDS (0.99), chloride (0.99), sulphate (0.92) and salinity (0.99) during high and low tides. The difference are BOD and DO have strong positive loading during low tide while turbidity and TSS were strong positive loading during high tide.","decade":2010,"doi":null,"asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["biochemistry","chemical engineering","environmental science","computer science","engineering"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering | Hydrology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","engineering","hydrology"],"annotation":["Oceanography","Climatology"]}
{"title":"Raindrop-aware gan: Unsupervised learning for raindrop-contaminated coastal video enhancement","year":2020,"keywords":["earth and planetary sciences"],"abstract":"2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We propose an unsupervised network with adversarial learning, the Raindrop-aware GAN, which enhances the quality of coastal video images contaminated by raindrops. Raindrop removal from coastal videos faces two main difficulties: converting the degraded image into a clean one by visually removing the raindrops, and restoring the background coastal wave information in the raindrop regions. The components of the proposed networka generator and a discriminator for adversarial learningare trained on unpaired images degraded by raindrops and clean images free from raindrops. By creating raindrop masks and background-restored images, the generator restores the background information in the raindrop regions alone, preserving the input as much as possible. The proposed network was trained and tested on an open-access dataset and directly collected dataset from the coastal area. It was then evaluated by three metrics: the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and a naturalness-quality evaluator. The indices of metrics are 8.2% (+2.012), 0.2% (+0.002), and 1.6% (0.196) better than the state-of-the-art method, respectively. In the visual assessment of the enhanced video image quality, our method better restored the image patterns of steep wave crests and breaking than the other methods. In both quantitative and qualitative experiments, the proposed method more effectively removed the raindrops in coastal video and recovered the damaged background wave information than state-of-the-art methods.","decade":2020,"doi":"10.3390\/rs12203461","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Engineering | Oceanography | None","cleaned_custom_domains":["engineering","oceanography"],"annotation":["Engineering"]}

{"title":"Morphodynamical and sedimentary features of the coast of the Phlegrean Fields (Campania, Southern Italy)","year":2002,"keywords":["archeology","geology","earth-surface processes","paleontology"],"abstract":"The Phlegrean Fields are one of the most famous volcanic areas in the world. During the last 50,000 years this area has been formed by the activity of many eruptive centres and today it has the typical morphology of a volcanic field. At present the Phlegrean Fields are active, even if the last event was recorded a long time ago: the Monte Nuovo eruption in 1538. The endogenous activity is currently recorded by the frequent inversions of the vertical crustal movements (bradyseism), by the sismicity connected to the bradyseismic events and by the intense thermal activity. From the Roman Age up to this time the features of the bradyseismic events have not been defined yet because of the type and complexity of the phenomena; recent research shows that the greatest submersion (1718 m) was verified during the early Middle Ages. After the resurgence phase the ground has risen only 67 m: the presence of the submerged Roman ruins shows the extent of the sinking.The coastal area could be divided into three clearly diversified sectors: the shore of Cuma constituting the western boundary; the Gulf of Pozzuoli representing the eastern zone, more complex and articulate; the shore of Miliscola, the central connection between the two preceeding sectors. The shore of Cuma.This sector, extending for about 6 km with N-S orientation between Licola Mare and Monte di Procida promontory, constitutes the terminal part of the coastal plain of the Volturno River, which flows approximately 20 km to the NW. The low and sandy beaches are limited inland from some foredune ridges, partly natural and partly urbanized. In the northern sector, behind the foredune ridges, there is a wide swampy area reclaimed during the last century (\"Mazzoni area and Licola Lake\") and in the southern sector there is the Fusaro coastal Lake. In the central part the promontory of Cuma interrupts the outline of the coast; this promontory was the centre of the Acropolis during the Greek-Roman Age, but today the Acropolis has almost entirely disappeared. Within the depth of 5 m the submarine beach shows one or two bar-trough systems: the inner one is crescentic and frequently connected to the rhythmic topography of the shoreline, while the outer one is linear and situated at a distance of about 100 m from the coast. A gentle slope characterizes the submarine beach beyond the bar-trough zone. The evolution of the shoreline presents a general erosional tendency during the years 1980-1987, whereas a tendency to the progradation is evident during the years 1987-1998. The prevailing wind sector is delimited by the 180-330N azimuth; most storms are come in from the 270-300N sector. The shore of Miliscola.The shore of Miliscola is situated between the Monte di Procida and Capo Miseno promontories and has an extension of approximately 2 km; it is limited inland from the Miseno coastal Lake. In the western tract we can find various defence works, while in the eastern tract a wide beach is evident. The submarine beach is characterized by a small bar-trough system within the 3 m depth and within a distance of less than 75 m from the coast. Eight circular breakwaters have been built from 1980 to 1988 because of strong erosion during the middle '70ies; in these years these defence works have brought an evident beach restoration. After which, until 1996, the shoreline position behind the breakwaters has remained substantially unchanged, while in the eastern part of the sector (toward Capo Miseno) an erosional tendency was observed with a value of 0.5 m\/y. The Gulf of Pozzuoli.This sector, extending for over 9 km and forming two large semi-circular zones with an W-E orientation, shows high and rocky coasts alternated with small, low sandy beaches. The prevailing wind sector is delimited by the 120N and the 200N azimuth; the significant waves come by the 120-130N and 180N azimuth; the maximum fetch and the greatest energetic potential concerns the 180N azimuth. In this area the modifications are very evident, natural as well as and anthropic. Among the natural ones there are the bradyseismic events, that have caused the submersion of entire coastal tracts (for instance: the structures of the Portus Iulius, the harbour of the ancient Roman imperial navy) and the Monte Nuovo eruption in 1538, that changed the coastal configuration in the western zone of the Gulf. Among the anthropic ones there is a strong urbanization (\"ILVA\" iron and steel industry, various defence work, artificial coastal platforms) that has completely destroyed the natural environment of the area.","decade":2000,"doi":null,"asjc_domain":["social sciences & humanities","physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["arts and humanities","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Geomorphology | Sedimentology | Geomorphology","cleaned_custom_domains":["geomorphology","sedimentology"],"annotation":["Social Sciences & Humanities","Sedimentology","Oceanography","Geomorphology"]}
{"title":"Population dynamics and production of the seagrass Zostera noltii in colonizing versus established meadows","year":2012,"keywords":["ecology, evolution, behavior and systematics","aquatic science","ecology"],"abstract":"The dynamics of the seagrass Zostera noltii in established and colonizing meadows were assessed in Ria Formosa lagoon, Southern Portugal. Shoot weight, above:belowground biomass ratio, flowering shoot density, meadow production, and biomass-density relationships were investigated. Results indicate that the species population dynamics differ clearly in different development stages of the meadows. The overall mean of flowering shoot density was five times higher in the colonizing (83flowering shootsm -2) than in the established meadow (16flowering shootsm -2), revealing a greater contribution of sexual reproduction during the species colonization process. The temporal variation of the biomass-density relationship in the colonizing meadow showed a cyclic seasonal trajectory, a wider range of data, and a simultaneous peak of biomass and density, suggesting no space limitations constraining the internal packing of shoots during the growing season. In the established meadow, density peaked before biomass in agreement to the dominant role of the clonal architecture of seagrasses in the configuration of closed meadows, suggesting the occurrence of self-thinning and\/or regulation of ramet formation. Slope of the biomass-density relationships was similar in the established and colonizing meadows, generally suggesting similar nutritional conditions, regardless of their muddy and sandy sediments. Plants of the colonizing meadow invest mainly on the belowground fraction (above:belowground biomass ratio <1), as meadow expansion is mainly controlled by the elongation of horizontal rhizomes. The annual total production (1163gCm -2year -1) and the biomass turnover (34.8year -1) were also higher in this meadow, corroborating the high investment of the species during the meadow expansion. The faster biomass turnover of the colonizing meadow implies a more limited capacity to accumulate biomass, indicating a greater exportation of organic carbon and nutrients to the coastal area. The different biomass turnover rates suggest different trophic and structural roles of Z. noltii communities in established and colonizing meadows. 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","decade":2010,"doi":"10.1111\/j.1439-0485.2011.00494.x","asjc_domain":["physical sciences","life sciences"],"asjc_field":["agricultural and biological sciences","environmental science"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Ecology | Chemistry","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology"],"annotation":["Ecology"]}

{"title":"Marine and meteoric diagenesis of submarine pleistocene carbonates from the Bermuda Carbonate Platform","year":1990,"keywords":["geochemistry and petrology"],"abstract":"The tectonically stable Bermuda Carbonate Platform has undergone repeated emersions and submersions in the course of the Pleistocene sea-level changes. Shallow seismic reflection profiling and high-energy vibration coring gave access to Pleistocene carbonates that are presently situated below sea level. A study of their diagenesis was undertaken in order to document the changes occuring in various diagenetic environments, to check a possible correlation between the state of diagenetic preservation and stratigraphic age, and to estimate the odds for a complete diagenetic imaging of a sediment's pore-water history. For the purpose of comparison, several samples from the modern Bermuda Islands were analysed as well. As indicated by their biogenic constituents, the submarine Pleistocene carbonates were chiefly composed of aragonite and high-Mg-calcite at the onset of diagenesis, whereas they now commonly appear as mixtures of aragonite and low-Mg-calcite. Marine cements (five kinds of high-Mg-calcite cement, three kinds of aragonite cement) are, as a rule, restricted to the intraparticle pore space. Meteoric influence inflicted neomorphism, cementation with low-Mg-calcite (several kinds of cement) and solution on the marine carbonates. These are characterized by patchy lithification, abundant preserved pore space and incomplete mineralogical stabilization. Furthermore, especially in lagoonal sediments, burrow or root structures have been preferentially cemented. Indicators of karst and calichification are common. High-Mg-calcite is usually the first mineral to disappear under meteoric influence; aragonite is more stable. Intensely altered carbonates consist entirely of low-Mg-calcite, whereas dolomite does not occur at all. Diagenetic indications of meteoric-phreatic alteration are generally uncommon, but support the idea of fresh-water lenses that are largely restricted to the proximity of the present islands. Most of the carbonates, however, have received their decisive diagenetic imprints in the meteoricvadose environment. The diagenetic record within the carbonates is incomplete. Only one pore-water change is recorded, from a marine to a meteoric environment. Undoubted post-meteoric marine cements are absent from the studied Pleistocene material except for some intensely lithified littoral deposits on the present islands. Obviously, the diagenetic potential of the marine environment was too small to compete with the meteoric environment. Under these circumstances, a reconstruction of pore-water history based on diagenetic sequences is deceptive. 1990 Springer.","decade":1990,"doi":"10.1007\/BF03174319","asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Geochemistry | Petrology | ","cleaned_custom_domains":[],"annotation":["Chemistry","Sedimentology"]}

{"title":"Hong Kong","year":2000,"keywords":["earth and planetary sciences","environmental science"],"abstract":"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of southeast China has a total land area of 1042 km2 and encompasses 235 islands of varying sizes. It is affected by an unusual combination of water masses which not only keeps the coastal waters of Hong Kong warm and maintains the local sub-tropical\/tropical biotic communities, but also allows temperate species to survive. It is greatly affected by freshwater dilution from both heavy rainfall during monsoons, and from the Pearl River which has an annual flow of 308 billion m3, from a drainage area of 228,000 km2. These may lower the salinity of the western and northwestern approaches to 1 to 7, while the eastern and northeastern waters remain virtually unaffected. These conditions create sheltered, estuarine environments to the west, exposed, oceanic environments to the east, and a transitional zone in the middle, typified by the Victoria Harbour region. Species surviving are both euryhaline and eurythermal, and able to tolerate highly sedimented waters. These natural stresses also make the marine fauna and flora much more susceptible to pollution stresses. Nevertheless, there is considerable plant life, including mangroves, and the bird life associated with sheltered shore and mangroves is of considerable international significance. There is heavy use of the marine environment. A pronounced decline in demersal fish stocks in the South China Sea due to over-fishing has occurred. The sea receives over 2 million m3 of waste water per day, and at present about 80% of Hong Kong's sewage is largely untreated. About 75% enters Victoria Harbour directly, representing a daily BOD loading of over 300 tonnes. As a result, many of Hong Kong's beaches are contaminated, especially along the western shores of the New Territories. There are some signs of a trend of improving beach water quality in general, but there are also increasing signs of harmful algal blooms. The huge volume of sea traffic in Hong Kong, with considerable paint stripping and painting, results in the release of chemical contaminants and biocides, e.g. tributyltin (TBT); the latter leading to concentrations of 53,000 and 18,300 ng Sn g-1 in sediments, which exceed typical levels recorded elsewhere. Farming practices have become more specialized, resulting in large increases in application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Crop and livestock farms are large sources of nutrient-rich and pesticide-laden run-off, the former being considered the culprit in an increasing number of red tides. Some pesticides include compounds that have been banned in Hong Kong (e.g. DDT), which are attributable to contamination sources in the Chinese mainland. Indeed, the annual discharge of the Pearl River accounts for over 85% of the total nutrient input to the local waters of Hong Kong. Rapid urban development has exerted an unprecedented pressure on the local marine environment. Large-scale reclamation has altered current patterns, reduced tidal flushing and caused hypoxia\/anoxia in many areas. During 1991 to 1999, a total of 366 million m3 of dredged spoil was disposed into coastal waters, and the new port and airport development involved the dredging of 880 million m3 of fill materials, and the dumping of 380 million m3 of dredged materials within a very small coastal area, affecting fisheries resources, coral, seagrass, benthos and water quality. Health issues, including PSP and ciguatera intoxication are a problem, and some 3 to 7% of shellfish samples contain unacceptably high levels of PCB and DDT. Some important wildlife areas are now protected. Habitats such as mudflats are increasingly scarce in south China; there are only 23 remaining sites with intertidal mudflat habitats within 800 km of Hong Kong. The large Mai Po\/Deep Bay Ramsar site is one such, and is described.","decade":2000,"doi":null,"asjc_domain":["physical sciences"],"asjc_field":["environmental science","earth and planetary sciences"],"raw_llama_custom_domains":"Ecology | Chemistry | Policy and Governance","cleaned_custom_domains":["chemistry","ecology","policy and governance"],"annotation":["Hydrology","Ecology","Oceanography","Chemistry","Social Sciences & Humanities","Public Health"]}

Additionally, a considerable amount of the seafood that humans consume comes from coastal areas where MP concentrations tend to be the highest. This research provides the first examination of MPs in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) that were grown locally in coastal areas of New York, contributing to a baseline for the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. A total of 48 eastern oysters (n = 12 per site, at four sites) and hard clams (n = 24 per site, at two sites) were sampled in summer 2021.
